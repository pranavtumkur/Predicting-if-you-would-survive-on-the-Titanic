Following are the steps, this project follows-

* Importing [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Perfoming EDA and forming inferences via the peculiar trends - [Link to the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pranavtumkur/Predicting-if-you-would-survive-on-the-Titanic/blob/main/EDA%20and%20ML%20model%20of%20Titanic%20survival.ipynb)
* Training, testing and optimizing a ML Logistic Regression model
* Create an index.html file to capture user inputs and send it to Python -[Link to index.html file](https://github.com/pranavtumkur/Predicting-if-you-would-survive-on-the-Titanic/blob/main/templates/index.html)
* Build a Flask API-
  * To deploy the index.html created to a generic web address
  * To receive user entered data into Python
  * To send predicted value back to the web address
* Deploy the Flask API to my [Heroku app](https://predicting-survival-on-titanic.herokuapp.com/) so it can be used by anyone and everyone 

* Bullet list
  * Nested bullet
    * Sub-nested bullet etc
* Bullet list item 2
